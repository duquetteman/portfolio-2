Portfolio created with Bootstrap.
## Purpose

This project was to construct a profile website using Bootstrap. A professional website will allow me to I wanted to showcase my creations to future employers.

## Challenges

* Conceptualizing how the bootstrap CSS code was affecting the website was difficult at first. Several times I removed the bootstrap CDN just to see what was affected, then added it back to witness the changes. 

* I had an issue with my Contact.html. When I pasted the code from the bootstrap website, the form fields were only 1/3rd the page width.

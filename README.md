Portfolio created with Bootstrap.
## Purpose

This project was to construct a profile website using Bootstrap. A professional website will allow me to showcase my creations to future employers.

## Challenges

* Conceptualizing how the bootstrap CSS code was affecting the website was difficult at first. Several times I removed the bootstrap CDN just to see what was affected, then added it back to witness the changes. 

## Acknowledgements

* Elements on the page were pulled from getbootstrap.com. 
* Special thakns to Luke Duquette who helped with CSS elements and layout.

                    <p>Welcome to my profile page! I am new to the world of web
                        development but I am excited to learn and create. As a developer, I wanted to create a
                        portfolio website so
                        that I can showcase my creations to future employers. I also wanted this to serve as a brief
                        introduction to
                        who I am and what type of employment I am looking for.</p>

                    <p>My education and professional experiences cover a broad spectrum. I have a BS in
                        Psychology from Iowa State
                        University, and an MBA with a Finance emphasis from Ashford University. I have worked
                        for
                        Apple for the last 9 years as a Senior Technical Advisor and Team Manager Support. Prior
                        to that, I worked for John
                        Deere Financial, supporting commercial loan customers. Before that, I was with AT&T in a
                        role that focused
                        primarily on customer support and sales, with team management duties assigned as needed.
                    </p>


                    <p>Learning web development has always been a personal goal. Only recently did I decide to
                        make it my new
                        career. I am working through the UT Coding Bootcamp and hope to find gainful employment
                        in the Austin area
                        after graduation. I would like to start in web developmemnt and eventually explore
                        machine learning and data
                        science. I am fascinated by the technologies that make our modern world work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I live in Pflugerville with my wife and 6 beautiful children. I enjoy spending time with
                        them and watching
                        them grow. We watch movies, take walks, and cook together. Family time is one of life's
                        little pleasures.
                    </p>
